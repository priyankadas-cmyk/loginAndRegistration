                    As noted by fashion scholar Susan B. Kaiser, everyone is forced to appear, that is, there is no unmediated way of being before others.[4] Whether we want it or not, everyone appearing before another is evaluated by the dress, their attire. This most commonly means how one looks, what colors, materials, and silhouette one wears on the body. Even if the garments are all the same, they will appear different; if the item is washed, folded, mended, or new.
                    The term fashion is plagued by its many different uses, and by the unclear application of the concept. For example, the term connotes difference, but also sameness. It signifies the latest distinction, as well as the return of the old. While it may be defined by an insular and esteemed aesthetic elite, who make a look exclusive, this look is often using references from those excluded from making the distinction.
                    Whereas a trend often connotes a peculiar aesthetic expression and often lasting shorter than a season, fashion is a distinctive and industry-supported expression traditionally tied to the fashion season and collections.[5] Style is an expression that lasts over many seasons and is often connected to cultural movements and social markers, symbols, class, and culture (ex. Baroque, Rococo, etc.).

                    While some exclusive brands may claim the label haute couture, the term is technically limited to members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture[8] in Paris.[5] Haute couture is more aspirational; inspired by art and culture, and in most cases, reserved for the economic elite.
                    Fashion is also a source of art, allowing people to display their unique tastes and styling.[9] Different designers are influenced by outside stimuli and reflect this inspiration in their works. For example, Gucci's 'stained green' jeans[10] may look like a grass stain, but to many others, they display purity, freshness, and summer.[1]
                    Fashion is unique, self-fulfilling and may be a part of someone's identity. Just like art, fashion does not have to be liked by everyone, it is an expression of one's tastes. Whilst art is usually locked into a drawing, sculpture, picture etc, clothes are a moving form of art; a unique characteristic.[9]
